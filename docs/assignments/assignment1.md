# Assignment 1: Social Media Needfinding

1. Hunch: 
“How might I design a social media app for people with visual impairments, particularly in elderly age groups? I want to be able to help an underserved community stay connected with others in their community and be able to learn and perform tasks a sighted person could do with social media”

2. Interview Plan
- The “who” and the “why”
I interviewed two visually impaired people who have used social media in the past. Dino is a 61 year old man who has been blind his whole life. He has used apps like Facebook (along with Messenger), LinkedIn, Twitter, Myspace, and a  little bit of Mastodon and Whatsapp. Sheri is a 53 year old woman who had sight but became completely blind a couple of years ago. She has used apps like Facebook, MySpace, and Youtube when she was sighted and also when she became blind. Neither participants are currently associated with a college which makes them different from me in terms of age, experience, and their disability. I chose to interview people with visual impairments from my previous projects helping this marginalized community. In high school, I built an app using the MIT App Inventor to help provide scribes to students with visual disability in government schools in Bangalore, India. Having friends and family with visual impairments has motivated me to continue developing similar projects!

- Recruiting participants:
I recruited participants via emailing local disability organizations in the New England area to see who would be interested in this study (sent out about 8 emails). Four participants replied but only two participants agreed to participate in the interview given there was no compensation. 

- The interview process
I have attached the links to the questions I asked them and also some notes I took during the interview. There are more detailed notes further down this page in the Interview Report.
