# Assignment 1: Social Media Needfinding

1. Hunch: 
- “How might I design a social media app for people with visual impairments, particularly in elderly age groups? I want to be able to help an underserved community stay connected with others in their community and be able to learn and perform tasks a sighted person could perform using social media.”

2. Interview Plan
- The “who” and the “why”: 
I interviewed two visually impaired people who have used social media in the past. Dino is a 61 year old man who has been blind his whole life. He has used apps like Facebook (along with Messenger), LinkedIn, Twitter, Myspace, and a little bit of Mastodon and Whatsapp. Sheri is a 53 year old woman who had sight but became completely blind a couple of years ago. She has used apps like Facebook, MySpace, and Youtube when she was sighted and also when she became blind. Neither participants are currently associated with a college which makes them different from me in terms of age, experience, and their disability. I chose to interview people with visual impairments from my previous projects helping this marginalized community. In high school, I built an app using the MIT App Inventor to help provide scribes to students with visual disability in government schools in Bangalore, India. Having friends and family with visual impairments has also motivated me to continue developing similar projects!

- Recruiting participants:
I recruited participants via emailing local disability organizations in the New England area to see who would be interested in this study (sent out about 8 emails). Four participants replied but only two participants followed up and agreed to participate in the interview given that there was no compensation. 

- The interview process:
I have attached the links to the questions I asked them and also some notes I took during the interview. There are more detailed notes further down this page in the Interview Report.

3. Interview Report
-  Dino: Dean, who likes to go by Dino, is a 61 year-old visually impaired individual who primarily uses apps like Facebook for entertainment and communication and LinkedIn for business posts and forming connections. However, during the interview Dino creates a tension between appreciating the connections formed on social media to his frustrations with accessibility issues. He critiques the inconsistency of labels on features across different social media apps. After sharing his screen, the both of us looked over how he uses Facebook on his laptop in detail. We noticed that there were at least 20-30 unlabeled buttons which were unreadable by his screen reader and navigating through the several features was really hard. I was so surprised to see this and I noticed some of his frustrations in this process as well. Dino would say things like “Shut up, I already know you (JAWS screen reader) can’t read the buttons” and “Okay, so that'll ramble”. This made me think about making my app  have features arranged in a less complicated way in order for the screen reader to easily read everything. It is important for an app to create that balance between innovation and inclusivity and I want my app to have just that.

4. Design Opportunities
- Including Alt text for images
- Having audio descriptions for videos
- Accessible Games
- easier captcha
- accessible messaging for screenreader
- reacting to posts
- all buttons are labeled 
- make menu items simple and easy to navigate for screenreader use
- a feature where you can contact available individuals to help you with tasks they cant do alone

5. Acknowledgements:
- I would want to thank TA's Peilin and Sophia for helping me with my questions and being patient with me. I also used ChatGPT to help me with generating some interview questions I can ask my participants. This was the prompt: " Please generate some interview questions I can ask participants with visual impairments who have used social media in the past and present. Make it in such a way which doesn't include biases, stereotypes, or any other offensive language to the community."
