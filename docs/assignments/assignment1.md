Assignment 1: Social Media Needfinding

Hunch
“How might I design a social media app for people with visual impairments, particularly in elderly age groups? I want to be able to help an underserved community stay connected with others in their community and be able to learn and perform tasks  a sighted person could do with social media”

The “who” and the “why”
I wish to interview two blind people (those in their 50’s, 60’s, and 70’s) who have used social media in the past. Dino is a 61 year old man who has been blind his whole life. He has used apps like Facebook (along with Messenger), LinkedIn, Twitter, Myspace, and very little of Mastodon. Sheri is a 53 year old woman who had sight but became completely blind a couple of years ago. She has used apps like Facebook, MySpace, and Youtube when she was sighted and also when she became blind.

What would you hope to learn from them that you might not already know or can infer relatively easily? I want to learn about?:
Unique workarounds or strategies they've developed to navigate social media platforms, which could inspire innovative design solutions.
Emotional and social impacts of using (or struggling to use) social media as a blind person, beyond just the functional challenges.
How their age intersects with their visual impairment in shaping their social media experience, potentially revealing needs specific to this demographic.
Unexpected benefits or uses of social media that might be particularly valuable for blind elderly users.
Subtle pain points in their user experience that might not be obvious to sighted designers or younger blind users.
Their perspectives on how social media platforms have evolved in terms of accessibility, providing historical context to inform future designs.
Specific content types or features they find most valuable or frustrating, which could guide prioritization in a new app design.

Recruiting participants:
I recruited participants via emailing disability organizations in the boston area to see who would be interested in this study (sent out about 8 emails). Four participants replied but only two participants agreed to participate for no compensation.

The interview process
I interviewed 2 people with visual impairments, Dino and Sheri (expanded more later in the section). These are the links to the questions I asked them and also some notes I took during the interview. There are more detailed notes further down this page.
