# Assignment 2

**1. Broad application goals.**
    - App name: Noor - it means “light” in Arabic, symbolizing the idea of shining a light to and illuminating the digital world for visually impaired users.
    - Description of intended audience: The app is designed specifically for people with visual impairments, with a particular focus on elderly individuals in this community.
    - Value beyond other apps: After conducting interviews with Dino and Sheri, two elderly blind participants, it became clear that mainstream apps like Facebook claim to be accessible, but they fall short in practice. Noor will fill this gap by providing an app for the visually impaired, focusing on features like streamlined screen reader navigation, accurate AI image descriptions, voice command functionality, and more other accessibility features that cater to the needs of elderly users as well. Noor wants to offer a more intuitive, enjoyable, and representative way for our users to connect with family and friends.

**3. Brainstorming feature ideas.**
    - Alt text on audio descriptions on photos and videos- All images uploaded on the platform come with AI-generated audio descriptions that provide detailed context about the contents of the image, including objects, scenery, and any people present.
    - Audio based notifications Notifications for messages, likes, and comments are read aloud to users through the app, allowing them to stay updated without relying on visual cues.
    - Feed filters- be able to change to only see friends and fam - Users can customize their social feed to prioritize posts from specific people (like close family or friends) or filter out less relevant content, ensuring they stay connected with the most important updates.
    - Assistance/ Online status feature: Check to see w hen someone is online so that you can get quicker responses in cases of emergencies (amongst elderly) 
    - Emergency Alerts - In case of an emergency (since the users might be elderly and visually impaired), a signal can be sent to close family members and friends to help them in need.
    - Keep the app simple to not overwhelm elderly individuals - The interface design is streamlined with larger buttons, fewer steps to complete actions, and a clutter-free layout to reduce overwhelm for elderly users.
    - AI image descriptions that are accurate Every image in the social feed is accompanied by an automatically generated, detailed description using AI. These descriptions provide context about the scene, objects, and emotions present in the image.
    - Accessible game plays for entertainment purposes- The app includes a range of simple, accessible games (like audio-based puzzles or memory games) designed to entertain and stimulate users.
    - Accessible CAPTCHA and security login - Dino was talking about how he can’t use apps like discord and amazon due to inaccessible CAPTCHA so a haptic or voice modulated CAPTCHA security protocol can take place.
    - Birthday notification feature - Users receive personalized audio reminders for friends' birthdays, events, or important dates, helping them stay socially connected and engaged.
    - Having support groups with other visually impaired people -The app provides virtual support groups where visually impaired users can connect, share experiences, and discuss challenges with others in similar situations.
    - Have a list of resources which visually impaired can use - Noor will offer a collection of resources like articles, guides, and videos about how to navigate the digital world as a visually impaired person.
    - Accessible messaging- The messaging feature will be fully compatible with screen readers, allowing users to easily chat with friends and family.
    - Voice command navigation 
    - Labeled buttons- Make sure all buttons and navigation tabs are labeled for better screen reader experience

**4. VSD analysis.**
    1. Stakeholders: Direct and Indirect Users
        - Observation: Direct stakeholders are elderly, visually impaired individuals who will interact with Noor for social engagement. Indirect stakeholders include family members, caregivers, and emergency responders. Caregivers may need access to some user data to provide proper assistance, raising privacy concerns.
        - Design Response: Creating a permission-based privacy information sharing system where users can choose specific information (e.g., location, emergency contacts) to be shared with caregivers.
    2. Stakeholders: Variation in Abilities
        - Observation: Noor target audience is elderly individuals with visual impairments, but users may also face other physical challenges like limited hearing or motor skills and have intersectional disabilities. This could affect how they interact with the app.
        - Design Response: Implementing a multimodal accessibility feature, such as offering speech alternatives like touch-based navigation with larger buttons. This would ensure that users with multiple disabilities can still use Noor.
    3. Values: Value Tensions 
        - Observation: A big value tension Noor might face is between privacy and caregiver oversight. Elderly users may want to maintain their independence and privacy, but caregivers may feel the need for more insight into the user's behavior for safety reasons.
        - Design Response: Offer different access levels to each person, where users can assign emergency-only access to caregivers or set certain data-sharing permissions (e.g., location sharing only when away from home for extended periods). This balances privacy with safety.
    4. Time: Long-Term Health and Well-Being 
        - Observation: Regular use of Noor could either improve or degrade long-term mental health and well-being. While it could reduce loneliness through digital interaction, over-reliance on the app for social connections may reduce physical activity and face-to-face socialization, potentially leading to isolation.
        - Design Response: Introduceing a "well-being" tracker to promotes physical and social activity. This will encourage users to engage with the world outside of their phone and plan physical meet-ups with friends and family.
    5. Pervasiveness: Widespread Use
        - Observation: As Noor gains popularity and widespread use, interactions within its ecosystem may shift. While it could enhance community building among the visually impaired, large-scale adoption might also lead to information overload or the creation of subgroups that foster isolation or conflict.
        - Design Response: Implement community moderation tools and structured group discussion formats that prioritize inclusivity and constructive interaction. Noor could also provide users with tools to manage notifications and interactions to avoid overload, while promoting positive social engagement.
