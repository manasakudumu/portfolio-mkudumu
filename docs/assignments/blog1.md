# L16- Design that matters 

## Shein's Supply Chain Nightmare

Lyel mentioned one of his startups, SourceMap that makes supply chain routes transparent to producers and consumers. Having learned about the harsh working conditions for workers globally—particularly those mass-producing products for tech giants like Apple—I immediately connected these insights to the Shein supply chain network.

In the world of fast fashion, where trends are constantly changing every second. Shein offers a case study of how broken supply chains can create human and environmental catastrophes. 

A dress priced at $5? How is that even possible? The answer lies in a complex web of manufacturing practices that prioritize speed and cost over human dignity and environmental sustainability. Here are some numbers:
- Workers enduring 18-hour shifts
- Wages as low as $0.57 per hour
- Factories operating in conditions that border on modern slavery
- Minimal workplace safety protections
- Child labor concerns
- Extreme environmental exploitation
 These aren't just statistics—they're human stories of survival and systemic oppression.

The environmental cost is also terrible. Textile factories dump toxic chemicals into local water systems, create massive carbon footprints, and generate unprecedented levels of waste. The saddest part about this system is its invisibility. Most consumers scrolling through the Shein website have no idea about the human suffering behind that goes behind each garment. We've created a space where distance and disconnection make us ignore the cost of our consumption. Supply chains have become so underlooked that even well-intentioned companies struggle to understand the full implications of their production networks. This was something Lyel touched up on as part of the Toms Shoes case study as well which I thought was very interesting.

Learning about SourceMap, Lyels startup, was so refreshing to hear. Pioneering technologies like SourceMap that can map these complex global networks would give consumers and businesses musch better visibility into the human and environmental stories behind every product. Supply chain transparency isn't just sometihng that is nice-to-have but it is more of an imperitive structure. As consumer we need to be aware and have intentional choice. Every time we create a purchase, we should be thinking about the kind of world we want to create.
